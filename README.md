# VIS Spectrometer Enclosure
A 3D printable enclosure for the miniture VIS spectrometer by leswright1977.
See https://github.com/leswright1977/PySpectrometer and https://github.com/leswright1977/PySpectrometer2. The top lid is designed to be fastened with M3 screws and bolts.

This enclosure might be updated to incorporate a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W holder if I am able to get my hands on one.
